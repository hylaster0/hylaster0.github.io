        <p>Upgrading a competitive deck is difficult when pulling random cards from Booster Packs, and rare cards can often cost $10 or more. Try asking directly if there are any cards they need, or go for high rarity versions of 'Staple' cards like the ones suggested at https://www.justinbasil.com/guide/appendix2</p>
