<h2>About This Song</h2>
<div><p>
This is one of my favorite songs to play on DDR! It's the very first Japanese song I translated. I revisited it later on to fix some issues, so here's the updated version.

<h2>Lyrics</h2>
<div><p>
<br/>Hey what is up with that gloomy face?
<br/>Seeing you down from heartbreak just feels out of place
<br/>The Skies and oceans are blue but exhibit grace
<br/>Just relax and feel the sun’s warm, sweet embrace.
<br/>There was - a feel good Situation:
<br/>Melodramatic premonition.
<br/>Came and said, “Congratulations!”
<br/>One day you will find someone.
<br/>Full of new dreams!
<br/>Full of new views!
<br/>A sweet and bright love radiates and will dazzle you!
<br/>Your heart shouts and the birds sing about how you’re so full of love already.
<br/>
<br/>Not long ago I started to cry
<br/>With no seeming reason or cause to justify
<br/>But out of the blue a memory of smiles came through
<br/>My spirit recovered from remembering you.
<br/>
<br/>Emotions need communication!
<br/>Take the time to express all your frustrations.
<br/>Alright! Congratulations!
<br/>One day you will find someone.
<br/>Full of new dreams!
<br/>Full of new views!
<br/>Send out the feelings made by the music of your heartstrings
<br/>Your love will reach into mechanical hearts and get them once again whirring
<br/>More love! Fulfilling love!  Fill every heart with the sweet sweet candy of love
<br/>There’s not enough love even though honestly I’m feeling stuffed already
<br/>
<br/>Glittering stars shine
<br/>Glittering pink stars shine down from the sky. 
<br/>Capture their wonder inside of your heart, and hold it dear so it never departs
<br/>The umbrella of love protects us from the other’s rain of hate
<br/>‘Til the sky clears and a rainbow is paint
<br/>Let us hold fast and just patiently wait
<br/>
<br/>There was - a feel good Situation:
<br/>Melodramatic premonition.
<br/>Came and said, “Congratulations!”
<br/>One day you will find someone.
<br/>Full of new dreams!
<br/>Full of new views!
<br/>A sweet and bright love radiates and gleams upon you!
<br/>Your heart shouts and the birds sing about how you’re so full of love already.
<br/>GO! GO!
<br/>Full of new dreams!
<br/>Send out the feelings made by the music of your heartstrings
<br/>Your love will reach in to mechanical hearts and get them again whirring
<br/>More love! Fulfilling love!  Fill every heart with the sweet sweet candy of love
<br/>There’s not enough love even though honestly I’m feeling stuffed already
<br/>Share a soft, secretive kiss and two will see
<br/>That love is oh so fulfilling
<br/>Yeah!
</p></div>
