<h1>Song: We're Different (or the Same) [chigau!!!] | Arist: ダイナミック自演ズ</h2>
<h2>About This Song</h2>
<div><p>
A song about not just overcoming, but embracing the differences between people and their experiences. This is a long song, and also a Duet, so be prepared for a bit more scrolling than usual!<br/>This song is fast, which makes it harder to sing than a lot of others. This is a song I'd like to revisit at one point to see if I can improve the lyrics.

<div><p>
<br/>B: 1, 2, NaN
<br/>You and I!
<br/>A: You and Me!
<br/>B: Differences
<br/>A: Plain to see!
<br/>B: Wonderful, don’t you agree?
<br/>
<br/>A: Somehow you and I managed to meet in this wide world
<br/>B: Timeline is N.K.T.
<br/>
<br/>Both: We defy probability miraculously
<br/>Isn’t that so?
<br/>
<br/>Typical days are always dry and dulling
<br/>Games at least offer mindless levelling
<br/>
<br/>Hey hey hey Wait there mister
<br/>Isn’t that tiring?
<br/>Let’s take a break and enjoy some pasta.

<br/>A: Huh? OK
<br/>With unrestricted mental shooting
<br/>SNS is the web’s dark siding.
<br/>
<br/>B: So tonight dial the volume of your headphones to the max
<br/>For blasting punk rock and similar tones
<br/>
<br/>A: Everyone has a different way of life
<br/>B: We are born and then we cry and then we
<br/>Both: Babble and confound
<br/>B: Somebody has a different way of life
<br/>A: Take the time to recognize that and we’ll 
<br/>Both: Find common ground!
<br/>
<br/>B: You and I!
<br/>A: You and Me!
<br/>B: Differences
<br/>A: Plain to see!
<br/>Both: Wonderful don’t you agree?
<br/>A: Different places can share the same sky, clouds, and imagery.
<br/>B: Timeline is N.K.T
<br/>A: We have crossed through time and space to meet
<br/>Both: Miraculously So
<br/>
<br/>A: You and I!
<br/>B: You and Me!
<br/>B: Differences
<br/>A: Plain to see!
<br/>Both: Wonderful don’t you agree?
<br/>A: How grateful I am you <i>had had</i> no other place to be!
<br/>B: Timeline is N.K.T
<br/>Both: That our paths crossed is just so lucky!
<br/>Isn’t that so?
<br/>
<br/>B: Their name is A, my name is B
<br/>Even regrettable things get a ‘Hooray’
<br/>This amusement park world fills me with glee
<br/>If there’s only one chance then take it and flee!
<br/>A: We all at one point have felt blue envy
<br/>But we all process it differently
<br/>B: We are all individuals
<br/>Which makes us all originals
<br/>So let’s all act irresponsibly
<br/>And see if everything plays out logically
<br/>A: Once the rain clears tears dry and we get lively
<br/>“OK, leeway” I was murmuring.
<br/>
<br/>B: Everybody may have the same starting line
<br/>A: But0 after birth our paths quickly diverge!
<br/>Both: Though we all share that!
<br/>A: The path to have a similar way of life
<br/>Both: Can you tell me all the secrets to it?
<br/>No, not really!
<br/>
<br/>B: You and I!
<br/>A: You and Me!
<br/>B: Differences
<br/>A: Plain to see!
<br/>Both: Wonderful don’t you agree?
<br/>
<br/>A: I like to see you laugh about the things you like in life.
<br/>B: Remember to never succumb to strife!
<br/>A: Hear this song, gather might, and push through the night. 
<br/>Go be a shining light!
<br/>
<br/>A: You and I!
<br/>B: You and Me!
<br/>A: Differences
<br/>B: Plain to see!
<br/>Both: Wonderful don’t you agree?
<br/>A: March to your own beat as you travel down life’s road
<br/>B: Don’t try to imitate anyone else!
<br/>A: You don’t know
<br/>Both: how their path differs from yours
<br/>Isn’t that so?
<br/>
<br/>B: Let’s go!
<br/>
<br/>A: Forcing yourself to see others’ ways of life
<br/>B: Once you make it second nature you can
<br/>Both: Meet with them half-way!
<br/>A: If you can put yourself inside of their shoes
<br/>Both: Look in the mirror and you may just find that all your problems
<br/>Seem far away!
<br/>
<br/>B: You and I!
<br/>A: You and I!
<br/>B: You and me!
<br/>A: You and me!
<br/>Both: It’s great that we can meet!
<br/>A: We hear the same song and derive different meanings
<br/>B: Timeline is N.K.T
<br/>Both: We defy probability miraculously
<br/>Isn’t that so?
<br/>
<br/>A: You and I!
<br/>B: You and Me!
<br/>A: Differences
<br/>B: Plain to see!
<br/>Both: Wonderful don’t you agree?
<br/>A: The things we like may not ever
<br/>Both: perfectly align, though
<br/>B: This allows us both to move forward
<br/>Both: On that day we had a chance meeting
<br/>Miraculously So
<br/>
<br/>B: You and I!
<br/>A: You and Me!
<br/>B: Differences
<br/>A: Plain to see!
<br/>Both: And that makes me giddy!
<br/>Everyday we bounce off each other so let’s ROCK’N’ROLL
<br/>B: I hope we can do this every day!
<br/>Both: Feelings flying out make us happy
<br/>Isn’t that so?
