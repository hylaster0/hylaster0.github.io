<h1> Base Set Evolution</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p><i>Base Set Evolution</i> Mission Statement: Blend elements of the traditional Base-Fossil format with updated game mechanics to create a unique experience enjoyable for players of either format.</p>

This is a 237 card custom format filled with a combination of imports, modified cards, and entirely new designs meant to create a recognizable environment that's simultaneously different enough to be worth playing. Here are the steps I've taken to achieve this goal:

<p>#1 Pokémon HP and Retreat values are based largely on their video game HP and Speed stats. This undoes 20 years of HP creep, returning us to numbers familiar in the original formats. This also helps provide the correct "feel" for each Pokémon; Chansey needs to have high HP, and Electrode needs to have low retreat, or the stats on the card won't reflect the Pokémon being depicted. In a similar vein, final stage Pokémon have been given a 20% HP increase to provide proper weight (for example, Venusaur's base 80 * 1.2 = 96, which rounds to 100HP).</p>

<p>#2 New card types like Supporters, Tools, and Stadiums are introduced. These mechanics have existed for the majority of the game's lifespan; you only need to travel 1 set outside of Base-Fossil to find the first Stadium, and Defender functioned like a Tool as far back as Base Set itself. We've also introduced Pokémon ex, which debuted in gen 3. Multiprize Pokémon are controversial to those that lived through the Tag Team and VMAX formats, but evolving 2-prize Pokémon formats are fondly looked back upon as high points of the TCG (e.g. gen 3, gen 7 pre-Team Up).</p>

<p>#3 A commitment to making Evolution Pokémon worth the deck space and resource investment to get them on the field. This is a problem both Base-Fossil <i>and</i> modern formats tend to have. Giving an evolved Pokémon 60hp and a 30-for-3 attack doesn't cut it when Hitmonchan and Scyther exist. Compared to Base-Fossil, evolved Pokémon will deal more damage and take less Energy; no more Kabutops 40-for-4 on Stage 2.</p>

<h2>Game Play Changes</h2>
<p>Rule Change 1: Players can attack on the first turn, but cannot use a Supporter card. This ruling comes from certain older formats, such as the RSE ex era.</p>
<p>Rule Change 2: If a player has no Basic Pokémon in their opening hand, they place those cards on the bottom of the deck, rather than shuffling <i>(the opponent still gets to draw a card)</i>. This change helps players get into the action faster and is especially helpful with new-to-TCG players that have trouble shuffling.</p>

<p><i>Optional Rule</i> When a Pokémon is played from the hand to evolve one of your Pokémon, draw cards equal to its Stage. If a Supporter card has an effect that draws cards, draw 1 less card with that effect.</p>

<h2>Pokémon Design Philosophy: Revamp and Reconstruct</h2>
<p>Card designs for this set come in three categories.</p>
<p>(1) Cards that did well typically maintain their original identity. Iconic cards get the ex treatment, becoming even stronger at the cost of giving up 2 prizes. Generic "goodstuff" like Retreat Aid Dodrio remain largely unchanged.</p>

<p>(2) Cards that fell short, but had potential, get adjustments to damage, energy costs, and effects.</p>

<p>(3) Cards unable to compete in the format are given new identities.</p>

<td>ex Pokémon take the strengths of iconic original cards and push them even further. Rain Dance now attaches to any Pokémon, rather than just Water. The HP is buffed to 140hp, and there's no limit on Energy Cards for Hydro Pump.</td>
<td><img src="Fresh Beginnings/Pokemon/106 - hitmonlee.png" class="thumbnail" height="346" width="249" /> </td>
<td>Hitmonlee lived in the shadow of its brother, but it now embraces its identity as a dedicated bench sniper. High Jump Kick can fly past the Active Pokémon and score a key Knock Out, but if Hitmonlee keeps going, he'll crash! Note the extra [C] in Hitmonlee's attack costs and the general improvement to Stretch Kick.</td>
<tr/>
<td><img src="Fresh Beginnings/Pokemon/019 - rattata.png" class="thumbnail" height="346" width="249" /></td>
<td>Rattata theoretically had a niche as a 20-for-1 attacker that resisted Psychic, but few serious decks would pick it over big normals like Lickitung or Kangaskhan. A new identity inspired by Magic's Relentless Rats opens new deckbuilding possibilities. 50-for-1 is incredible, but are you willing to fill your deck and bench with a 30HP Pokémon to take advantage of it?
<td><img src="Fresh Beginnings/Pokemon/020 - raticate.png" class="thumbnail" height="346" width="249" /></td>
<td>Raticate serves as a threatening boss to a dedicated Rattata deck, but also maintains its original niche in Super Fang. The effect for Super Fang reflects prints from later in the TCG history, allowing it to combo with Poison-inflicting effects. Rattata loses its resistance to reflect its status as a mob Pokémon, but Raticate keeps that part of its identity as well.</td>

<h2>Trainer Design Philosophy: Maintain and Modernize</h2>
<p>Ask a player of another game what makes Pokémon stand out, and they'll mention cards like Professor's Research. With no sideboard, heavy counts of powerful draw and search is what keeps Pokémon decks running and able to find tech cards. 

Computer Search is incredibly powerful, but allows skill expression via the discard cost. It fits right at home in Base SetIt's a card I want in the format, and that means other Items like Energy Search gets buffs to stay appealing.</p>

<td>Computer Search is incredibly powerful, but allows skill expression via the discard cost. It fits right at home in this format and its presence defines how other Items are handled.
<td><img src="Fresh Beginnings/Items/Energy Search.png" class="thumbnail" height="346" width="249" /></td>
<td>To compete for deck slots against Computer Search and Professor Oak, weaker cards like Energy Search receive buffs to stay relevant. By copying the effect of Professor's Letter, we make it easier for decks to run multiple types of Pokémon and also provide value to Rain Dance.
<tr/>
<td><img src="Fresh Beginnings/Items/Full Heal.png" class="thumbnail" height="346" width="249" /></td>
<td>The introduction of Tool cards makes Full Heal a bit stronger, now able to proactively prevent damage from Burn and Poison.
<td><img src="Fresh Beginnings/Supporters/Professor Oak.png" class="thumbnail" height="346" width="249" /></td>
<td>And Supporter cards are a great way to bring certain effects in-line with more modern counterparts. Oak, Gust of Wind, and Super Energy Removal are all important pieces of the format; making them supporter cards lets the effects remain in place without becoming overbearing.

<h2>Set and Subset</h2>
With over 200 cards, Base Set Evolution can be overwhelming for new players. That's why I've separated it into 3 distinct subsets, each with different goals.

<p><b>Fresh Beginnings</b> features 82 cards (including basic energy) and is meant to serve as an introduction not just to the format, but to the Pokémon TCG as a whole. Featuring the Starter Pokémon, recognizable early-game companions like Butterfree and Pidgeot, and the remastered members of the Haymaker squad, there's enough in here for around 10 different deck archetypes. All of the most important consistency Items and Supporters can be found here, giving every deck the oil it needs to run. Much like with the mulligan rule change, several cards are designed to place cards on the bottom of the deck and avoid shuffling and aid the new player experience.</p>

<p><b>Journey</b> sets out to fill the format with powerful Evolution Pokémon representing a variety of trickier strategies, old and new. With this expansion, you can manipulate your HP with Alakazam's "Damage Swap", alter retreat values with Dodrio and Tentacruel, and learn to carefully manage your bench to avoid runoff from the "Earthquake" attack. Supporter cards here are more specific and targeted towards enhancing your deck's gameplan in ways beyond card draw. For example, Gambler buffs the results of your coin flips, letting flip-reliiant attackers like Sandslash and Exeggutor deal more damage.</p>

<p><b>Lunar Eclipse</b> introduces "Lunar Pokémon", a subset similar to Light, Dark, or Plasma Pokémon. This set also introduces Stadium cards, but the main theme of this set is controlling tempo. Pokémon include big basics like Lapras and damage mitigators like Mr. Mime. The Supporter cards feature the retrains of Super Energy Removal and Gust of Wind.</p>
