<h1>Base Set Evolution - Fresh Beginnings</h1>

<body>
<div>
<p>Base Set Evolution: Fresh Beginnings is an 82 card set meant to serve as the starting point for both players and Pokémon. Like Base Set Evolution as a whole, Fresh Beginnings is designed to be a standalone product playable on its own. 
Players trying the format out will have access to the starters, various early game Pokémon like Beedrill, and the iconic members of Haymaker decks. With recognizable Pokémon and simpler Trainer effects, this set can be used to teach players the Pokémon TCG.
</p></div>
<h2>Starter Pokémon</h2>

<div><p>Bulbasaur. Charmander. Squirtle. Pikachu. Eevee. Most of these Pokémon are recognizable, even if someone's never consumed a piece of Pokémon media in their life. There's no world where they don't headline the first subset, so let's dive in!</p></div>

<td colspan="3">
<p>Base Set Venusaur is best known for its Energy Trans ability, which combined with Pokémon Center to act as a full-board heal. I wanted switching energy around to be a more niche effect in the format, so the line has been reworked to interact with Poison and Healing in a way that maintains its "tank"-style gameplay.
Every member gets an Ability, encouraging players to set up multiple lines. Parapoison Vine has the ability to inflict Poison (2), which can heal 20 damage from 2 Pokémon if Bulbasaur and Ivysaur are both in play.
Venusaur maintains Solar Beam from its original print, now at just 2 Energy. Use it to grab a Knock Out after Parapoison Vine.</p>

<img src="../Fresh Beginnings/Pokemon/005 - charmeleon.png" class="thumbnail" /> 
<img src="../Fresh Beginnings/Pokemon/006 - charizard.png" class="thumbnail" /> 
</div>
<div><p> Charmander has a 30-for-1 attack, making it among the hardest hitters for basics that can evolve into a Stage 2. The biggest change comes with Charizard, which has its original ability baked in--it can now attack using only Colorless Energy.
This frees up space for Bathed in Flames, which applies a constant Burn to the opponent's Active Pokémon. This means you can take a KO and chip the next Pokémon, bring up a Charizard after your own Pokémon is KOd for counter damage, or even combine Charizard with attackers like Squirtle, retreating to the Bench and then applying Burn damage in between turns. Charizard applies consistent offensive pressure without ever even needing to attack. However, Charizard's this comes at the downside of being a Stage 2 with only 90HP; you'll need Defender and healing items to put Charizard to full use.</p></div>

<img src="../Fresh Beginnings/Pokemon/008 - wartortle.png" class="thumbnail"  /> 
<img src="../Fresh Beginnings/Pokemon/009 - blastoise.png" class="thumbnail"  /> 
</div>

<div>
<p>Squirtle and Wartortle use their shells to safely hide on the bench while setting up Blastoise. If they get stuck in the Active Spot, Rapid Spin returns them to safety for just 1 energy. These cards don't have the field presence of the Bulbasaur or Charmander lines, but the reward is Blastoise ex, an "uncapped" version of the original Base Set Blastoise: it now has 140hp, Rain Dance attaches to any type of Pokémon, and Hydro Pump has no damage limit.
This card can have a huge impact once it hits the table, but finding Blastoise and enough Energy to power up your board is a test of resources and deckbuilding.</p>
</div>
<div>
<img src="../Fresh Beginnings/Pokemon/133 - eevee.png" class="thumbnail"  /> 
<img src="../Fresh Beginnings/Pokemon/134 - vaporeon.png" class="thumbnail"  /> 
<img src="../Fresh Beginnings/Pokemon/135 - jolteon.png" class="thumbnail"  /> 
<img src="../Fresh Beginnings/Pokemon/136 - flareon.png" class="thumbnail"  /> 
</div>

<div>
<p>Eevee evolves into multiple types of Pokémon, so it makes sense to lean in on this for the design. Chain Reaction comes from its Black Star Promo print, while version split copies the effect of Palette of Friends. All 3 evolutions can attack using just Colorless energy, making it a great starting point for a weakness box deck.</p>
</div>

<div>
<img src="../Fresh Beginnings/Pokemon/025 - pikachu.png" class="thumbnail"  /> 
<img src="../Fresh Beginnings/Pokemon/026 - raichu.png" class="thumbnail"  /> 
</div>

<div><p>Pikachu floods the bench, while Raichu wants as few Benched Pokémon as possible. This anti-synergy is intentional, reflecting the anime's focus on Raichu's brute strength vs Pikachu's resourcefulness. Pikachu maintains the original Thunder Jolt attack and loses the downside. Call for Family is designed to set up Eevee's Version Split, but can also be used in other strategies. For example, Charizard requires 4 energy to attack, but Blastoise can make that easier with Rain Dance.</p></div>
<h2>Venusaur Support</h2>
<div>
<img src="../Fresh Beginnings/Pokemon/048 - venonat.png" class="thumbnail"  /> 
<img src="../Fresh Beginnings/Pokemon/049 - venomoth.png" class="thumbnail"  /> 
</div>
<div>
<p>Venonat's Compoundeyes works as a standalone ability for decks looking for the perfect time to drop Imposter Professor Oak. Triple Spore heals and poisons, working perfectly with Bulbasaur and Ivysaur.
<p>Venomoth's ability may seem weak to modern era players, but the lower overall HP makes attacking into Venomoth a risky proposition. With a Defender and an empowered Double Leech, opponents will struggle to keep any damage counters on this bug.</p>
</div>
<div>
<img src="../Fresh Beginnings/Pokemon/109 - koffing.png" class="thumbnail"  /> 
<img src="../Fresh Beginnings/Pokemon/110 - weezing.png" class="thumbnail"  /> 
</div>
<p>Weezing can explode, dealing a total of 90 damage for just 2 Energy. Alternatively, keeping it on the bench will boost the power of your Poison effects, providing additional heals with Bulbasaur.</p>

<h2>Blastoise Support</h2>

<div>
<img src="../Fresh Beginnings/Pokemon/116 - horsea.png" class="thumbnail"  /> 
<img src="../Fresh Beginnings/Pokemon/117 - seadra.png" class="thumbnail"  /> 
</div>

<p>Seadra's Galloping Sea allows on-the-board Energy manipulation. It's meant to serve as a backup to Blastoise, able to come in once your other attackers have been weakened. If you can avoid OHKOs, you can chain Seadra with Scoop Ups to keep a stream of healthy attackers incoming.</p>

<div>
<img src="../Fresh Beginnings/Pokemon/060 - poliwag.png" class="thumbnail"  /> 
<img src="../Fresh Beginnings/Pokemon/061 - poliwhirl.png" class="thumbnail"  /> 
<img src="../Fresh Beginnings/Pokemon/062 - poliwrath.png" class="thumbnail"  /> 
</div>

<p>Did you know that Red's starter Pokémon wasn't Pikachu, but Poliwag? Poliwhirl's Dynasty Buster can get revenge on the rat, inflicting 60 damage for just one DCE. Poliwrath keeps this anti-Lightning theming going with its Ability, which allows it to hit most Lightning Pokémon for weakness!
Poliwrath's Water Gun scales faster than Blastoise and Seadra's attacks as a reward for settting up multiple Stage 2 lines. Whirlpool is an attack from its original printing in Base Set, now costing 2 energy and dealing an extra 10 damage.
Poliwag combines the two attacks from its Neo Discovery print, as it felt more appropriate than simply having another Water Gun user.</p>


<img src="../Fresh Beginnings/Pokemon/058 - growlithe.png" class="thumbnail"  /> 
<img src="../Fresh Beginnings/Pokemon/059 - arcanine.png" class="thumbnail"  /> 

<p>The Arcanine line functions as a standalone attacker, but is meant to serve as a partner to Charizard. Growlithe's Stoke can be used during the early turns to get Energy flowing on the Charmander line, and with even 1 Arcanine in play, Charizard's passive damage increases to 60 per turn, a great return on investment of 0 energy. When Charizard isn't available, Flamethrower is a servicable 50-for-2 attack. If you're willing to pay 3 Energy, though, it also inflicts burn, bringing the damage total up to 90 (or more!) after Burn Up.</p>

<tr/>
<td colspan="3"><p>The early game bugs both fully evolve at Level 10, so the TCG cards are designed to let them evolve fast and hit hard early before falling off. Butterfree received a total rework to emphasize its status as an early game bug. Pollen Gather offers strong card draw, but falls off quickly once both players have set up. Both attacks also now feature bonus effects when used on the first turn. Silver Wind is a potential donk at 80 damage (70 after Double Rainbow), and then offers a consistent 50-for-2 afterwards. This is balanced out by Butterfree's low HP and lack of ability compared to Pokémon like Venusaur.</p></td>

<tr/>
<td colspan="3"><p>Beedrill's Swarm Sting is inspired by Link Needle Beedrill from EX Fire Red & Leaf Green, while Twinneedle is a common attack on the cards. With the additional poison, it's quite strong for a 1 Energy attack. As an early game bug, I wanted it to be strong early, but to struggle to trade efficiently against bulkier Evolved Pokémon.</p></td>

<tr/>
<td colspan="3"><p>Air Mail Pidgeotto is a rare instance of a future Pokémon being directly imported into the format. It does everything I want it to do as a Support Pokémon. Pidgeot takes the ability one step further, allowing 2 cards with no downside. The Twister attack is low on damage, but makes up for it with the devastating effect of returning all Energy attached to the Defending Pokémon to the hand.</p></td>

<div>
<img src="../Fresh Beginnings/Pokemon/052 - meowth.png" class="thumbnail"  /> 
<img src="../Fresh Beginnings/Pokemon/053 - persian.png" class="thumbnail"  /> 
</div>

The Persian line is meant to serve as a counterpart to Pidgeot. It gets the famous Trade ability, granting access to Draw 2 on a Stage 1 at the cost of discarding cards. In a head-to-head, Meowth and Persian outclass Pidgey and Pidgeotto. Bad Deal Pounce does a fair chunk of damage while also furthering the card advantage provided.

<div>
<img src="../Fresh Beginnings/Pokemon/019 - rattata.png" class="thumbnail"  /> 
<img src="../Fresh Beginnings/Pokemon/020 - raticate.png" class="thumbnail"  /> 
</div>

<p> Rattata theoretically had a niche as a 20-for-1 attacker that resisted Psychic, but few serious decks would pick it over big normals like Lickitung or Kangaskhan. A new identity inspired by Magic's Relentless Rats opens new deckbuilding possibilities. 50-for-1 is incredible, but are you willing to fill your deck and bench with a 30HP Pokémon to take advantage of it?</p>
<p> Raticate serves as the boss of dedicated Rattata decks, while also maintaining its original niche in Super Fang. Compared to Base Set, the effect is buffed to match later printings. Reducing the opponent to 10HP allows it to combine with Poison Spray for a Knock Out on any Pokémon in the game.</p>

<div>
<img src="../Fresh Beginnings/Pokemon/021 - spearow.png" class="thumbnail"  /> 
<img src="../Fresh Beginnings/Pokemon/022 - fearow.png" class="thumbnail"  /> 
</div>
<p>Inspired by its printing in Battle Styles, Fearow is designed to be a simple above-curve attacker. The only Stage 1 dealing more damage for a single energy is Raichu, which only works on the turn it evolves. Even if not viable in hyper-competitive decks, I think Fearow would be a great pickups in drafts or cubes.</p>


<div>
<img src="../Fresh Beginnings/Pokemon/027 - sandshrew.png" class="thumbnail"  /> 
<img src="../Fresh Beginnings/Pokemon/028 - sandslash.png" class="thumbnail"  /> 
</div>
<p>Sandslash is one of the simplest cards in the set, but shouldn't be overlooked. An average of 40-50 damage usable with just 1 DCE/DRE lets it reliably score OHKOs when hitting for weakness. Combine it with other Colorless attackers to take on a variety of opponents. 

<img src="../Fresh Beginnings/Pokemon/132 - ditto.png" class="thumbnail"  /> 


<h2>Haymaker</h2>
<div><p> When someone thinks of Base-Fossil, they think of Haymaker. There's no better way to round out the Pokémon of <i>Fresh Beginnings</i> than by showcasing my takes on these iconic cards.</p></div>
<div>
<img src="../Fresh Beginnings/Pokemon/125 - electabuzz.png" class="thumbnail"  /> 
<img src="../Fresh Beginnings/Pokemon/107 - hitmonchan.png" class="thumbnail"  /> 
<img src="../Fresh Beginnings/Pokemon/106 - hitmonlee.png" class="thumbnail"  /> 
</div>
<div>
<img src="../Fresh Beginnings/Pokemon/123 - scyther.png" class="thumbnail"  /> 
<img src="../Fresh Beginnings/Pokemon/124 - jynx.png" class="thumbnail"  /> 
<img src="../Fresh Beginnings/Pokemon/126 - magmar.png" class="thumbnail"  /> 
</div>
<div>
<p>The first thing you'll notice compared to the Base counterparts is that these cards have all gotten <i>stronger</i>. It might seem strange to buff what are already considered best-in-class cards, but if a card like Scyther is going to compete against new threats like Venomoth and Arcanine, non-evolving Basics need to feel big and have immediate board presence.
<br/>
Electabuzz and Hitmonchan get the ex treatment. Electabuzz is the big winner, as the system-wide HP and Retreat changes buff its stats up. At the same time, it loses the self-harm in Thunderpunch and can amp its damage up even further with Static Charge, discouraging opponents from attacking recklessly into it. Hitmonchan takes <i>punch hard</i> to the next level, with Jab now dealing 30 damage and Special Punch (now Punch Up) gaining an effect that directly lets it tango with evolved Pokémon. These changes may seem overwhelming, and that's the exact gameplay feeling I wanted these cards to give. Haymaker should open the game strong and takes an early lead; however, with only 80HP on a 2-Prize Pokémon, evolution decks that survive this early onslaught will be able to stabilize and even out the prize trade.
<br/>
The rest of the squad sees buffs too. Scyther and Jynx can now swing turn 1 with a DCE (hello, weakness box!), while Magmar combines some of the best traits from its 2 prints. Hitmonlee also makes a name for itself outside the shadow of its brother, with High Jump Kick offering a 50 damage bench snipe. Going first and with a DCE, this attack can take out a surprise knockout against the majority of evolving basics. In return, Hitmonlee takes some damage itself, making it easy for a return KO.</p>
