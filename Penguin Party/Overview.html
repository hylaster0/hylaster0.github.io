    <h3>Rules</h3>
    <p>Rules
At the start of the game, separate the Nest cards and shuffle them. Each player draws one. Any remaining Nests are shuffled together with the rest of the deck.

    Each round, every player drafts 4 cards. In other words, every player draws 4 cards from the top of the deck, but they only keep one! Pass the other cards clockwise around the table until all cards have been drafted, then place your hands face-up on the table.


    Starting with the dealer, each player selects 3 of their cards to play. For Penguins, Accessories, Nests, and Food, this involves "Stashing" the card in your score pile, but there are also a variety of Action cards that apply special effects. At the end of their turn, each player discards cards from their hand until only 1 remains.


    Play continues until the deck is empty. At this time, each player organizes their Nests. Each Nest is able to hold up to 3 of each card type (Penguins, Food, Accessory). After this, scoring begins.</p>
    
    <h3>Scoring</h3>
    <p>For each nest with 1+ Penguin, add up the points of all cards located within the nest. If a nest has been filled to its limit of Penguins, Food, and Accessories, score an additional 5 points.


    Don't let the Penguins go hungry! A Nest with more Penguins than Food loses 1 point per Penguin per missing food. For example, a Nest with 2 Penguins and only 1 Food comes with a -2 penalty, while 3 Penguins sharing a sole item would be -6 (3 Penguins * 2 Food Missing).


    Don't let your food spoil! Any food not assigned to a nest is worth -1 point.


    A Nest with no Penguins awards no points, but can be used to store excess Food without penalty.</p>
